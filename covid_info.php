<li>Adopted a policy of no entry to a cottage once is has been cleaned so that guests can enter knowing that the cottage knowing it has not been entered by anyone after cleaning. Keys are sanitised by the cleaners upon the door being locked after cleaning has taken place.</li>

<li>Removed our welcome baskets as they can not been cleaned safely, welcome gifts are now individually wrapped and left for guests without a box.</li>

<li>Removed extra decorative items that could be handled but not effectively cleaned.</li>

<li>Placed the remotes in wipeable bags so that they can be sanitised at change-over.</li>
