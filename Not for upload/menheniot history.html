      </span>HEN I FIRST CAME TO LIVE in Menheniot, I knew little about it, except that some of my ancestors and marital relations had once lived here. It was by chance, or fate if you will, that my husband and I bought the old house at Tregrill, with no knowledge of its history. An early attempt at renovation soon revealed even to our inexperienced eyes that many mediaeval features still remained, exposed by stripping away the coats of more modern cladding.<br/>Curiosity drove me first to research the house, then the tithing of Tregrill, and finally the manor of Menheniot. To write the full history, even&nbsp;to<span class="s16"> </span>the year of 1600, would be a vast and cumbersome task, involving the reproduction of documents and land deals, deeds and charters, weighty in matter and tedious in reading. Some,<br/>the more important texts, have been transcribed, but mostly I have confined myself to quoting extracts where they seem pertinent to the subject matter. My aim is to produce a history that is suitable for the layman, yet not wholly despised by the more serious students.<br/>I have often used original spellings, as I believe this adds to the sense of history, and I have used many words which are generally obsolete, but have always given an explanation of these where I feel it <span class="s15">to </span>be necessary for the layman's understanding.<br/>Much more could be written. In the meantime, I hope that this brief history will provide an insight into Menheniot as it was, and that it will spur on others to take an interest in the past of this beautiful parish.<br/>My thanks go to Dr. G. Tregidga, Institute of Cornish Studies, Exeter University, to Kevin Raddy, Sue and Tony Davies, and last but far from least, to my husband, Richard Gendall for helping me to produce this little book.</p>

      <br/>HE EARLIEST EVIDENCE OF OCCUPATION in the present parish ofMenheniot comes from Clicker Tor, a volcanic outcrop to the south<br/>of the village. In 1994 Mr G. Walford was field-walking in the area as<br/>part of a project to interest people in archaeology, when he noticed a high percentage of flint scatters. Working with other volunteers, he divided part of a field between Clicker Tor and the A38 road into 30 metre squares, and the flints in each division were collected and separately bagged. Although between seven and eight hundred flints were recovered, a great many more remain, but it must be remembered that being privately owned land, the public must nor enter the field for the purposes of flint hunting without the permission of the owner.<br/>The flints were all beach flints, possibly from Seaton, some being of good quality, and ochers of chert, a lesser quality scone. The earliest finds may be microliths, little stone barbs, about half an inch long and daring from the lace Mesolithic period.<br/>The Mesolithic period was<br/><span>
        <img src="menheniot history/Image_005.gif" width="292" height="191"/>
      </span><br/>between c.8000 B.C. and c.4000 B.C.<br/>The majority of che finds dare from the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, at a rime when flint was just being replaced by metal, the Neolithic<br/>period scarring at c.4000<br/>B.C. and the Bronze Age<br/>at c.2300 B.C. There was <span class="s15">Flint cores and pressure flaking tool from Clicker Tor.</span><br/>a gradual change from one period to another, so the dates given are not absolute.<br/>The Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age people were hunter gatherers whose culture later merged with chat of the Neolithic or new stone age. These were the first farmers.<br/>The very high percentage of flint cores suggests char the sire was a flint knapping centre, and char the finished products, arrowheads, scrapers etc., were sent or traded away from<br/>the place of manufacture.</p>
    <p class="s19">5</p>
    <p class="s18">Menhenior- a brief history to A.D.J600</p>
    <p>One tool of particular interest was a stone approximately the size and shape of<br/>a slightly flattened sausage, and was probably used for pressure-flaking the sharp edges of the flint weapons. A stone axe also dating from the Neolithic period was found in<br/>the region.</p>
    <p class="s20">It <span class="p">was recorded in the last century that a Bronze Age barrow had been discovered somewhere in the Clicker Tor vicinity,&middot;possibly at Tor Farm, although the exact whereabouts is unknown. Two pottery sherds were recovered from the barrow, one piece being sent to Plymouth Museum, and the other to Truro. These were parts of</span></p>

The larger of the vessels was probably a cremation urn.<br/>Tin was found at Clicker Tor, although we do not know at how early a date it<br/>was extracted, the only evidence of tin works coming from a much later period. In 1287 and 1290, William Bodrugan had bought land at Middle Clicker from Pagan de Clicker and his mother, Elena. In the Parliamentary Rolls of Chancery, Aug. 15th 1473, a court case was recorded involving a descendant of William called Henry Bodrugan, who with Richard Bonithon and their &quot;riotous servants&quot; entered the land of Thomas Nevill at<br/><span>

    <p>Clicker and robbed it of tin and other goods. They then attacked the house of Thomas. Tin was important in the manufacture of bronze, and worked in Cornwall from early times. We cannot know when tin was first discovered and taken from Clicker Tor.<br/>Daring from the Iron Age are the remains of a hill fort at Padderbury Top. It has never been excavated, so its exact date is unknown, but possibly it was built about<br/>300 B.C. Many forts were constructed, then re-constructed several times, but without archaeological evidence no precise dates can be given. The fort is approximately!30m in diameter, and there are now only two visible banks surrounding it, although the ditches between have gradually filled in. The inner bank is some 3m high, and the outer, <span class="s11">a,</span>bout. lm, is ploughed down scarp. <span class="s6">Ir </span>is hard to see the entrance, which was probably on the eastern side of the fort. Aerial photography has shown that there were originally four ramparts, one more between the two existing banks and an outer bank, now only visible in the crop-marks.<br/>Aerial phorography also showed that there had been two, and possibly three ring settlements outside the fort <span class="s26">to </span>the south-west, about 60m in diameter. These were probably Iron Age farms, dose enough to the fort ro seek protection in times of trouble.</p>

      <br/>N EARLY HISTORY THERE ARE NO RECORDED FACTS about what was later to become Menheniot, although certain things are known. Tregrill was already inhabited in the first century A.D., and was probably the home of a local<br/>chieftain. Pottery sherds dating from the period were found in the garden ofTregrill Yean, and these were identified as Romano-British Exeter ware. This does not mean that it was the site of a Roman villa, but rather that the inhabitants traded with the Romans, or perhaps received the pottery vessels as tokens of friendship and goodwill. The name Tregrill was unlikely to have existed at that time, because the tre-element<br/>in place-names developed in the post-Roman period, c.450 A.D. onwards. <span class="s20">It </span>is probable<br/>that eventually the treav, or homestead, was occupied by someone with a name equivalent of the Welsh <span class="s29">Ceril, </span>tre <span class="s30">+ </span>Ceril giving us Tregrill (see under Place-Names).<br/>The next evidence we have cannot be dated for certain, but Lallowy's Holy Well at Menheniot, and possibly the well with a reputation for having healing properties at Tregrill, seem to suggest that there was early Christian activity in the fifth or sixth century. It was the habit of early Christians to adopt wells sacred to the British and adapt them as baptistries, the old gods being turned into saints wherever possible. In this case the pan-Celtic god whose name occurs as <span class="s29">Llew, Lleu </span>or <span class="s29">Lugh, </span>(Light) and<br/>who had a skillful hand, (Ia-, prefixed, means hand in Cornish), became St Lallow,<br/>or Lalluwy. His feast day was on the 1st. August, which later became Lammas in the<br/>Christian calendar.<br/>Local tradition states that St Corentin stayed at Tregrill to educate a king's son, and although this cannot be taken too literally, Saints' Lives suggest that the legend<br/>is very old indeed, and there may well have been an early Christian settlement there.<br/>Several centuries pass when there is neither documentary, archaeological nor even a traditional history of the area. However, there were documented events for South East Cornwall which must have impinged on the lives of the people who lived<br/>at Menheniot.</p>
    <p class="s6">8</p>
    <p class="s18">First Century A.D. to Domesday</p>
    <p>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records for the year 835/8</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Here a great ship-host came to the West Welsh <span class="p">(Cornish) </span>and they united together and made war against Egbert, King of the West Saxons. When he heard of it, he fared hither with a fyrd, and fought against them at Hingston <span class="p">(Downs) </span>and there put to flight both the Welsh and the Danish men.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Cornish were known ro the English as rhe Welsh or <span class="s17">Whealas </span>at this rime, a name which remained until rhe Middle Ages.<br/>The fact that the Danes and the Cornish combined in an attempt to drive away the English at the battle of Hingston Down within reasonable marching distance of Menheniot, and that the battle was important enough to be mentioned in the English Chronicles, implies that a great many fighting men almost certainly including those<br/>who lived in Menheniot must have joined their fellow Cornishmen and fought <span class="s16">to </span>defend their homeland from rhe English; indeed it would have been very odd if they had not.<br/>After the battle Cornwall remained an independent kingdom at least until the death of Donierr, her last recorded king, a local man whose monument still stands by the roadside at Sr. Cleer. He must have been the dominant figure in South East Cornwall. The Welsh Chronicles, <span class="s17">Brut y Tywysogyon, </span>recorded his death in the year<br/>876, <span class="s17">Ac y bodes Dwngarth, vrenhin Kernyw, </span>&quot;and there was drowned Dwngarth, king<br/>of Cornwall.&quot; The names <span class="s17">Doniert </span>and <span class="s17">Dwngarth </span>are cognate, and rhe style of lettering on the monument agrees with rhe date given, so there is lirde doubt that they are one and the same. Although we have no evidence char he was connected with Menheniot, local tradition cells us chat his court was in Liskeard, close enough to impact on the lives of chose who lived in what was centuries later to become the parish of Menheniot.<br/>From the death of Donierr to rhe rime of the Norman invasion there was little recorded activity. In rhe lOch century rhe Saxon king, Athelsran, appointed a Cornishman, Conan, as Bishop of Cornwall with his see at Sr Germans. This probably had little effect on rhe local populace whose lives were still hard, governed as much<br/>by the seasons as the overlords, and whose daily roil altered nor at all.</p>

      <br/>HE HISTORY OF MENHENIOT is not just a matter of dates and sterile faces. <span class="s20">It </span>has been shaped by the ambitions, passions and deeds of the men and women who lived in the parish, and includes such diverse actions as<br/>a vicar who ran off with a married woman, accusations of bigamy, fights with daggers, questions of paternity, and a whole range of human activity, enough <span class="s16">to </span>satisfy the fans of any modern day soap-opera.</p>
    <p class="s20">It <span class="p">is in the Domesday Book compiled in the reign of William the Conquerer in</span></p>
    <p>1086 that the first information about the parish is found. Menheniot did not exist as<br/>a village then, but Tregrill, the lords of which later established the village, and which was the dominant tithing in the area, was inhabited, and the Domesday Book notes that</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Osjerth <span class="s8">...... </span>held Tregrill. A/ric held it before 1066 and paid tax for one virgate of land; one hide there however. Land for seven ploughs; two ploughs there,&middot; two slaves, four villagers and twelve smallholders. Woodland one acre,&middot; pasture sixty acres. Formerly sixty shillings, now twenty shillings.&quot;</p>
    <p>Many of these words are not understood today, bur in modern terms it means that Osferth, who was an under tenant, held Tregrill from the Count of Mortain, the half brother to William the Conqueror. Alric, who held the land before the Conquest, had paid tax for thirty acres, although one hundred and twenty acres (approximately) were there. There was enough arable land for seven teams of oxen (there were eight oxen<br/>to a ream, and each team was called a &quot;plough&quot;), but<br/><span>
        <img src="menheniot history/Image_009.gif" width="363" height="166"/>
      </span><br/>only two teams of oxen were worked. There were two slaves, four free poor labouring peasants, and sixteen richer small-farming peasants.<br/>There was one acre of woodland and sixty acres for grazing<br/>cattle.</p>

    <p class="s15">Artist's impression ofTregrill Yean as it rnay once have looked.</p>
    <p>There were of course other settlements in the parish, but they were often members of the Manor ofTregrill. Listed in later manor rentals are Pennarrhe, Pengover, Trewynte, Trenant, and Tregarrecke. Also found are Bodway, Lambesta, Trevaffa and many other names, with a variety of spellings, that are still recognizable today. Tencreek was once<br/>an important house, and was in the possession of Richard, Earl of Cornwall. Hals, in 1685, wrote ofTencreek,</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Here groweth a sort of tree, bearing a strange sort of leaves and fruit, or berries, not seen in any other part of Cornwall, and therefore without name given it by me or others.&quot;</p>
    <p>In the 14th century Tencreek was inhabited by the Helligan family, whose members will feature frequently in these pages. Tencreek, earlier spelt as &quot;Trencrake&quot;, had licence for a private chapel in 1385, renewed in 1396, 1411 and 1420. When Tencreek was being modernized in the 1900's, human skelerons were found beneath the floors although no explanation for them exists.<br/>Cartuther, which Hals claimed was once pertaining to the nuns of the Poor Clares of Liskeard, was also mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was held by Richard from the Count ofMortain, and had previously been held by Cola. He had paid tax for one hide (120 acres) but one and a half a hides were there. There was I;H:Id fo<span class="s29">&quot;10 </span><span class="s17">ploughs, with 4 ploughs there. There were two slaves, 6 villagers and 7 smallholders. There was pasture land of20 acres, and woodland of 12 acres.&quot; </span>Irs former value was 40s, at the time of the Domesday 25s. There were 2 carde and 60 sheep. In 1429/30 Edmund<br/>Beckett and his wife Anastasia had a licence for their chapel there, dedicated to</p>
    <p class="s6">11</p>
    <p class="s18">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D.I600</p>
    <p>St. Nicholas. Another Domesday holding was Trehawke. Brictmer held it before 1066, and paid tax for 1 ferling of land, 1 virgate there. There was land for 2 ploughs,<br/>1 plough there. Trehawke had 2 smallholders and 5 acres of pa tur. _Its v&lt;l:lue, both formerly and at the compilation, was 5s. There were 5 cattle, 3 pigs and 60 she p. Yet another Domesday holding was Penhawger. Aelmer held it before 1066, and paid tax for<br/>1 virgate of land; I hide there however. There was land for 16 ploughs, in lordship there was one plough. There were 4 slaves, 11 villagers and 30 smallholders with 7 ploughs.<br/>30 acres were pasture land and 4 acres were woodland. The value had formerly been<br/>60s, it was then 30s. Penhawger must have been a seat of scandal in 1313 when Giles the parson of St. Ive carried off the wife and possessions of John de Thorn tone of Penhawger, and refused to return them. There is no record to say whether or not the woman involved was a willing participant, but Giles lost his benefice and later left<br/>the diocese.<br/>The 12th century was a period of time for which there are no local records.<br/>It is necessary to go through the time of civil war between Stephen and Matilda, only guessing at local loyalties by what was happening in the rest of Cornwall. In 1140<br/>Stephen granted Cornwall to Alan who styled himself Count of Brittany and Earl<br/>of Cornwall. Alan himself was nephew to Brian of Brittany who held Cornwall before<br/>1076, just prior to Robert of Mortain. Alan was in Cornwall with some of the king's men, driving out a rival claimant, Reginald de Dunstanville, but by 1141 Reginald appears to have secured Cornwall for himself, receiving the title from Robert of Gloucester, one of Matilda's strong supporters. How much of this affected the local lifestyle cannot be known without clear evidence, but the Christian name Stephen seems to occur frequently in men from Menheniot, which may show local sympathy with the king.<br/>In the thirteenth century records start to appear regularly. There is an undated reference to Sir Otes de Tregrilla in the first half, and in 1260 there is the first mention of Menheniot, then spelt <i>Mahiniet, </i>when Stephen Heym was installed in the church<br/>on August 9'h&middot;. William de Tregrilla was the church Patron. Stephen was succeeded<br/>by Adam Heym on 26&bull;h December 1275. In this second record, the spelling <i>'Meyniet' </i>was used. There is another early reference to Menheniot in the Valor of Pope Nicholas c.1291. Tregrill at this time was still the main centre of habitation, and the old house remains, a 2* listed hall-house, much altered over the years, but still identifiable by many architectural features. A grander, bigger house was built dt an undated period,<br/>but this later burnt down. Other historical features remain at Tregrill including the</p>

The well is still used at Tregrill Yean for the main water supply, and some of the older residents used to believe it had healing properties.<br/>William de Tregrilla, the son ofOtes, was dearly an important man. In 1266<br/>he was a witness on a charter granted to Liskeard by Earl Richard, King of the Romans, and again in 1284 he was witness on a document headed <i>&quot;Twelfhindna Morl', </i>now known as Twelve Men's Moor, north of Minions.

This means that the shield had a red background, with the symbol of a silver pelican wounding her breast to feed her young with her own blood, a popular device in the Mediaeval period to represent self sacrifice. The young pelicans in the nest were gold. This device was later quartered with the arms of the Trelawnys, showing that a marriage united the families. The Trelawny arms were Argent (silver) with a Chevron, Sable (black). Later three oak leaves, Vert (green), and an acorn, Or, (gold) were added.<br/>COATS OF ARMS<br/><span>

      <br/>Tregrill was at this time a tithing, an Anglo Saxon word which originally meant a company of ten homesteads in a system of frankpledge, whereby every member was answerable for the good conduct, or damage done by, any one of the other members. Trea or treav was the Cornish name for such sreadings, found prefixed as tre- or trev&shy; in many Cornish place-names. Gradually the tithing came to mean rhe area of land on which the company of homesteaders lived, and the name remained even when many other householders inhabited it. The Lord of the Manor might have lands in other areas which had to pay him rental, but they were not considered to be parr of the tithing. Within the tithing even important people and establishments had <span class="s16">to </span>pay homage to the Lord of the Manor. For example, Walter, the Prior of St Germans, was bound <span class="s16">to </span>do suit, service and homage to Sir Richard de Tregrilla at the Court ofTregrilla for the holding ofLambesta (Lambest). St Germans had at that time to pay <span class="s26">to </span>the Lord ofTregrill at<br/>the death of any prior a death duty on Lambest, but Adam de Helligan released the<br/>priory from this duty in 1336.<br/>It was after the church had been built that Menheniot sl wly. b_ecarr;e the main centre of habitation. An undated record shows that Robert de Penhauger and Basil his wife released to Sir Ores de Tregrilla a farthing's land in Menheniot, called the Hall<br/><span>
        <img src="menheniot history/Image_015.gif" width="526" height="275"/>
      </span><br/>of Menheniot. Another account showed that Basill, widow of Robert de Penhauger, released to Richard de Tregrilla half an acre at Hall, under the rown of Menheniot, which her brother Reginold once held. Tregrill was still the home of the lords of the manor. Maude de Tregrilla, widow, and daughter of Sir Ores, once Lord ofTregrill, released Tregrill to William de Tregrilla, her brother. Another undated record notes that William de Tregrilla gave by<br/>bond half an acre in Shill Hall to<br/>&middot;Robert de Helligan.</p>
    <p class="s18">Mediaeval Menheniot</p>
    <p>The increasing importance ofMenheniot was shown in the record of 1291. William, Lord ofTregrill, feoffed to Thomas and Stephen, sons of Stephen de Tregrilla,<br/>a farthings land in Menheniot in the South Hillonde, and three acres in the North Hillonde to be holden in socage (rent) by a red rose entail. If this rather touching agreement, a form of peppercorn rent, suggests that the men concerned were the son and grandsons of William, then they must have predeceased him, because when William died he left three daughters to inherit. Isabella, the eldest, married Walter Doyngnell, Emme or Emma, the second daughter married Robert de Helligan, and Johanna, William's third daughter, married John St Winnow. Thus the name of the de Tregrilla family died out.<br/>It is through the descendants of these daughters and their marital connections that the Trelawny family enter the records of Menheniot. Walter and Isabella had a son Adam Doyngnell, a grandson Richard, and a great grand-daughter Joan. She married William Trelawny. They had a son, John Trelawny. Robert and Emma had a son, Peter, a grandson, John, and a great grandson, Nicholas. His only daughter Joan married<br/>John Trelawny, son and heir of the John Trelawny descended from Walter and Isabella. By intermarriage, the blood-line of the de Tregrillas and Trelawnys were mixed twofold. Two parts of the manor and advowson belonged to John Trelawny, one part through<br/>his own descent in the sixth generation from Isabella, and one part from his marriage to Joan descended in the forth generation from Emma. John Trelawny then bought the third part from Sir Ralph Berry who had inherited it outside the direct descent of]ohanna, and so had all the manorial rights ofTregrill and the right of advowson.<br/>In the early 1300's there are many records of the Doyngnells, the Helligans and the St Winnows, often involving the advowson of the church for which there was great rivalry, and small details of land transference. From these records it is possible get an idea of the other people living in the village. For example, in 1317 it is known that Walter de Ia Torre held the lands at Torre, and there is the first mention of the mill ofTregrilla, although the miller's name is not given. In 1348 the Black Death entered Britain, but records of all those who died do not exist. The unfortunate victims were<br/>so numerous that they were generally buried in mass plague pits outside the main village, and this gruesome site might be located in the far south-east corner of the parish, where the names Bones Hill and Bones Wood occur. Excavation would be<br/>necessary to confirm this.</p>

    <p class="s9">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D.J600</p>
    <p>The accounts of the enfeoffments and rentals show that a dear difference is made between the Cornish and the English acre. In 1323 Johan de St Winnow feoffed in entail to Stephen, son of Stephen ofTregrill and Muryell his wife, half an acre Cornish in Menheniot at a rental of 8s 6d. In 1331 there wa:s feoffed to Walter Bere ofTregrill land excepting one acre English. The amount of land involved was vastly different.<br/>The Cornish acre was larger than the English, its size being dependent upon the fertility of the soil, so when dealing with property and land coverage it was necessary to distinguish between the two. We have another example that also indicates the position<br/>of an early mill.</p>

    <p>In 1365 a famous man, William ofWykham, became the incumbent<br/>of Menheniot. He was later to be made<br/>Bishop ofWinchester, and was at one time Chancellor of the Realm, but being a pluralist (one who holds two or more benefices at the same time) it is highly<br/>unlikely he ever visited this parish.</p>

    <p class="s9">Mediaeval Menhenior</p>
    <p>From an early time there seem co have been disputes about the advowson (patronage, right of presentation to a benefice) of the church. For example, in A.D.1293 we read:</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Final agreement made in the King's court at Westminster on the morrow of St. John the Baptist 21, Edward I between Ralph de Stonhus and Cecily his wife, plaintiffs, and William de Tregrilla, deforciant, of one messuage and one camcate of land <span class="p">(dwelling</span></p>
    <p>with outbuildings and land assigned to its use) <span class="s17">with appurtenances in Tregrilla and the advowson of the church of St Laluwy, whereof a plea of warranty of charter was summoned between them in the same court.

    <p class="s17">had of the gift of the same William. And for this acknowledgement Thomas and Cecily have granted to the same William the said messuage&middot;and carucate with appurte ances.

To hold of the chief lord of the fee by the services which to that land pertain for ever.&quot;</p>
    <p class="s20">It <span class="p">is worth noting that for a second time a rose was used by William de Tregrilla as a form of peppercorn rem.</span></p>
    <p>The tide to the advowson \vas not a problem that went away. In 1317 there was agreement between Adam Doyngnell and Adam de Helligan that the latter should go to Westminster before the King's Justices, and there acknowledge that it was the right<br/>of Adam Doyngnell <span class="s16">to </span>present to the church ofMenheniot (then void) by reason of the eldest party. In return he would acknowledge that Adam de Helligan had the second turn. By 1361 the question of the advowson had, temporarily at least, settled down. Richard Doyngnell, son and heir, granted to Sir Richard Stapledon the next presentation of the Church of Menheniot, then void by the death of Richard de Bodleigh. In 1367 there was an acknowledgement by John de Helligan to Sir Ralph Carminowe t at if &middot; Ralph Carminowe paid &pound;20 to John de Helligan and gave <span class="s16">to </span>John Bodrugan in Tudy,<br/>in the Manor ofTynren, <span class="s36">to </span>be held by knight's service, then John de Helligan would give <span class="s16">to </span>Ralph all his right of the Church of Menheniot with the advowson.<br/><span>

    <p class="s9">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D.1600</p>
    <p>There is another agreement recorded, undated:</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;whereas john, son of Adam de He/ligan holds of Sir Ralph Carmynowe all Tregrill, Menheniot and Shilhall by knight's service and suit to Boconnoc Court every three weeks, which service Sir Ralph released to him and his issue for ever in exchange for a grain of corn at Michaelmas, for this john de He/ligan gives Sir Ralph and his heirs his part of the Church of Menheniot and the advowson.&quot;</p>
    <p>Ralph Carmynowe seemed <span class="s15">to </span>have a special affection for Menheniot, since he was buried there.<br/>In 1405 Bishop Stafford allowed the Patronal Feast (that held on the local saint's day) <span class="s36">to </span>move from March <span class="s20">8'h </span>to Ocrober <span class="s20">2&quot;d, </span>but today it is celebrated on October <span class="s20">6&bull;h. </span>There is no recorded reason given for this change, but there seems to have been no disagreement, and it must be assumed that it answered some local need.<br/>By <span class="s20">1422 </span>there was disagreement again about the advowson, and again it was taken <span class="s15">to </span>the King's Bench at Westminster. Richard Haukeford, Armiger, (a squire with the right to bear a coat of arms) sued John Mason and Thomas Carmynowe, Armiger, for the right of presentation <span class="s15">to </span>the Church of St Laluwy. Richard Haukeford was a<br/>descendant of Richard Stapledon who had at one time held the presentation, and who, with his brother Walter, Bishop of Exeter, had been enfeoffed by Joan, the third daughter ofWilliam de Tregrilla, of her share of the advowson. Richard claimed his right through this enfeoffment and the interpretation of the agreement. The history<br/>of Menheniot Church was far from peaceful!<br/>Away from the troubles of the church, there are insights into the lives of the common people. <span class="s20">It </span>may come as a surprise <span class="s15">to </span>some that in an age where women were often forced into arranged marriages, that there is one record where a woman was given a choice, and the chosen man none!

He left two sons, Richard,<br/>his heir, and John of Menheniot, and from the latter a great deal of trouble later ensued.</p>
    <p class="s6">I8</p>
    <p class="s18">Mediaeval Menhe:niot:</p>
    <p>The fortunes of the Manor of Menheniot and the Tithing ofTregrill were at this time in the ascendancy. In 1436 it is documented that</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Hugh Courtney, Lord of all the Tithing.r ofTregrilla and Menheniot grants to john Trelawny esq. All liberties and customs and suits at court of the inhabitants and residents in the Tithing ofTregrilla with all villains, waifs, estrays, View of Frankpledge in Tregrilla and Menheniot to be holden of him as of his manor of Boconnoc by 12d yearly and suit twice</p>
    <p class="s17">a year at the court there. 6 Oct, 15 Hen Vl.&quot;</p>
    <p>This deed, a little premature since overlords did not usually have the power of such grants, was ratified by the king in the following year. A Vieof Fr.ankpiedge.was . a meeting held periodically for the production of the members of a tithing, or later<br/>a manor, within a system of frankpledge with Court Leers, courts held in that tithing<br/>or manor before the lord or his steward, having jurisdiction over petty offences and the civil affairs of the district.<br/>The minor rivalries over the advowson were nothing in comparison with the family feud that erupted in the Trelawny family a few decades later. In 1456 Richard Trelawny died leaving two daughters as heirs. His brother, John Trelawny ofMenheniot, disputed their right of inheritance, claiming they were bastards. He claimed they were born before the espousals of Richard Trelawny and Agnes Henwood, and the Bishop<br/>of Exeter was asked to hold an inquest. The Bishop found that Richard and Agnes had been lawfully married in the Church of St. Ive, and <span class="s17">&quot;had issue johan and Isabell in wedlock&quot;.</span><br/>John did not give up the fight easily. 1455 found a</p>

    <p class="s17">they were brought into the world begotten and conceived in wicked prohibited and damnable coiture, the proof whereof he prayed to be admitted. The official however, contrary to all</p>

    <p>John and his men caused as much trouble for the women as they could, to such an extent that in 1462 Ed. Laurence had <span class="s16">to </span>make an undertaking by an action of law not to molest Isabell and Johan. His oath was wimessed at Exeter Cathedral by an official of the Bishop. Even then John continued <span class="s16">to </span>press his claim. There was a report <span class="s16">to </span>the council that John was the heir <span class="s15">to </span>the estates, and that Johan and Isabell, the<br/>two daughters of Richard, were &quot;begotcen in shameful adultery with Agnes, he having<br/>deserted his wife for 28 years&quot;. In 1465 there is another record of a dispute between John Trelawny and John Penpons and Jane (Johan) his wife &quot;touching the land of the late Richard Trelawny&quot;. The battle continued outside the lawcourts. In 1474 Richard Wase, the husband ofisabell, and others were indicted for entering the lands ofJohn Trelawny at Tregrill and other places, and taking his goods.<br/>In 1505 matters were still not settled, and there was another enquiry as to whether<br/>&quot;Richard Trelawny and Agnes Henwood were ever coupled in lawful matrimony&quot;, but John himself had to suffer retaliation for his efforts, and he made a petition to Parliament against &quot;Bodrugan and ochers for riotous entry into Wolsdon and other lands in question between him and Wase and for the wrongful ejectment of Blanch, wife of the said John, and his children from the house&quot;.<br/>The two women eventually won their inheritance, and in 1593 Edward Trelawny compiled a book in which he recorded &quot;... <span class="s17">and with these daughters went from this</span></p>

    <p class="s9">Mediaeval Menheniot</p>
    <p>It was not only in Menheniot that there was strife at this time. The Wars of the Roses began in the early 1450's, and, as in the rimes of Stephen and Matilda, there is no record oflocal involvement, but more can be assumed about loyalties through this time of national conflict. Menheniot and Tregrill came under the overlordship ofBoconnoc, and Hugh Courtney (he who had granted the View ofFrankpledge) sided with the house of Lancaster, so <span class="s8">it </span>is probable that local loyalties followed him. Whether any local men were involved in battles is uncertain, but five marks are recorded as having been paid to Courtney by Trelawny as knight's fee (OED 'The amount ofland for which the services of an armed knight were due to the sovereign&quot;). Hugh Courtney was put<br/>to death after the Battle ofTewkesbury in 1471.<br/>In spite of troubles both at home and away, all was not doom and gloom. On the<br/>5th December 1487letters patent were sent by King Henry VII to John Trelawny esq. for a fair, the View of Frankpledge, Court Leer and Correction of Assize of bread and beer in the Manor ofMaheniot (Menheniot).</p>

    <p class="s17">pulverosis, <span class="s30">= </span><span class="p">&quot;dusty footed&quot;) which was a summary court held at fairs and markets to administer justice among itinerant dealers, a mediaeval equivalent ofTrading Standards.</span></p>
    <p>The area where the fair and market were held was on the west side of the village, towards the present cricket pitch, the location at one time being named Fair Meadow.<br/>In 1497 the Michael Joseph/Thomas Flammank rebellion started at St Keverne in West Cornwall. This was an insurrection over unduly high taxation and corrupt officials, but once again we have no records <span class="s16">to </span>show how, or even if, men from Menheniot were involved. Knowing the common man's general dislike of taxation<br/>it is- hard <span class="s15">to </span>imagine that the rebels did not have local sympathy, or that at least some</p>
    <p class="s39">22</p>
    <p class="s9">Mediaeval Menhenior</p>
    <p>villagers did not join the rebels. It is interesting ro note that after the culminating battle of Blackheath it was recorded that the arrows the Cornish had loosed were of an unusual length, <i>&quot;...</i><span class="s17">so strong and mighty a bow the Cornishmen were said to draw&quot;. </span>This was at the rime when the English bowmen were said to reign supreme!<br/>As with all villages, Menheniot had an archery range, later called Butts Park (a burr is an archery target) and it was situated behind whar is now rhe school playground. We have several references ro archery in Menheniot. An undated one reads: <span class="s17">Bowes that were soled to the use of the paryshe by the hands of Mr. Trelawny and delyveryd as hereafter follows in payments. </span>Then followed a list, now lost, of 42 men who paid two shillings each for their bows, and one man who paid four shillings. The difference in price is considerable, bur can easily be explained. The best quality bows were made from imported Mediterranean yew. In fact every ship trading in the Mediterranean areas<br/>had by law to bring back baulks of yew timber. The erroneous belief that yew trees<br/>were grown in churchyards to supply men with bows can be dismissed, not only by the records, but by the fact that it would take several generations for one tree to mature, and years for the cut wood to season. Even allowing for enough straight limbs to make many <i>bows, </i>the wood of English yew is invariably very knotted and badly grained. Some<br/>bows were indeed made from English yew, but not many. For every bow made of yew,<br/>a bowyer had by law to make a certain quantity from lesser <i>woods; </i>elm was a favourite, and ash was a second choice. These would have been the cheaper bows, the expensive one that of imported yew.<br/>In 1557 there is another record,</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Parochia de Mentrewright, Hundred do Est <span class="p">(Menheniot Parish, in the Hundred of East). </span>Be it knowing that <span class="s40">I, </span>john Trelawny esquier, hath received of Thomas Maye and John Cook, constables of this pariche of Menhenyet to by sertaine artilyre as X bowes, III shaffi of arros</p>

    <p>In the Menheniot muster roll for 1563, out of 83 able bodied men capable of fighting between the ages of sixteen and sixty, a high proportion were armed<br/>with bows and arrows, or had access to them, as opposed to bills or pikes. The Muster Roll also gives an indication of the population of Menheniot. Most of the men prqbably had wives, then allowing for the infirm, the elderly, babies, children and boys too young to fight or girls not yet married, the clergy and the gentry, the total population was probably less than five hundred. This estimate is allowing for high infant morrality, and<br/>the fact that life expectancy was considerably less than it is roday.</p>

    <p class="s15">A document signed by John Trelawny in 1577 regarding the purchase of archccy equipment,</p>
    <p>In the 1500's there are examples of the Court Leer proceedings, the names of many parish inhabitants, and their positions in society, or their misdeeds. In 1506 records show that Roger Bray was the reeve (overseer, the word sheriff derives from <span class="s17">Shire Reeve), </span>and John Dovy the bailiff. John Shave was the butcher. We had a taster of ale, Jo. Collard, and a way-warden, William Hodge. The tithing man, or tithing<br/>representative, was Jo. Hoper. The butcher, John Shave had reason <span class="s35">tO </span>complain, and it was recorded, <span class="s17">john Waite unjustly entered and broke the land of john Shave at Shillhall, and there bounded a tin-work without leave of the said john&quot;. </span>There is a similar dispute about the tin works (streaming, not mining) in 1514 when &quot;John Waite ofTregrilla and other co-possessors or possessors of the tin-work at Saythencomb broke the meadow ford of John Shave&quot;.<br/>The name Sayrhen has already been encountered, spelt as Seythen, when referring to the River Seaton. Combe signifies valley, while Shilhall in Menheniot is often mentioned. Earlier references to tin deposits being worked in Menheniot, at Clicker Tor, in 1473 have already been noted.<br/>The courts seemed jealous of their rights and the boundaries that were laid down. At an undetermined date at this period John Gyll impleaded that John Ronnel!had<br/>been at the &quot;King's court for his Hundred of Est Wevyll touching a trespass within the<br/>jurisdiction of this court, contrary <span class="s16">to </span>the custom&quot;. There was trouble if a crime committed within a frankpledge was tried outside it!</p>
    <p class="s7">24</p>
    <p class="s9">Mediaeval Menheniot</p>
    <p>In 1511 the officers of the parish were listed as reeve, John Russell, tithing-man, Roger Braye, market-keeper, Henry Wennmouth, canal-raker and custodian of the pinfold (a pound for stray animals), William Hady, The woodwarden was Walter Martin. One of the listed crimes was that</p>
    <p class="s29">&quot;Robert Ronell ofTreughyll in the Parish of Menheniot, and in the Decana <span class="p">(Tithing) </span>of Tregryll and liberty of this franchise, on 10 Aug. armed with sword and sticks, entered the close of john Teny of Cotayne, where they broke a brazen patella, and carried it away.&quot;</p>
    <p>At the same court lesser misdemeanours were also noted; e.g. John Hoper and John Neider had some pigs loose at the Town of Menheniot, and John Drayneck pastured two horses at Brendon without licence. At the same sessions, John Ron nell was reported as having assaulted John Snell with a sword called a hanger. In this year<br/>also was recorded the death ofJohn Hady, within the Manor ofMenheniot, at Shillhall.<br/>It was noted that there was no tenant there, only a &quot;sojourning stranger&quot;. An earlier record of 1293 places Shillhall within the bounds of the Manor ofTregrill, showing again how Menheniot and Tregrill were closely linked.<br/>In 1513 the bailiff presented Henry Gefferay to the court for having used slanderous words about John Gyll when speaking to John Arundel. In the next year there was another assault, that of John Lenn who attacked Richard Cony between &quot;Mynhynyot and Tregyndale Downe&quot; with a stick and a dagger. Also in 1514 it is recorded that Robert Ronnel!broke the Lord's pond at Stenebrygge (Stonybridge)<br/>and turned away the water supply that William Trembrace had there, with the service (rental) of2 capons. The water was turned onro the vicar's land. There was more trouble over water rights when Robert Pope broke the Mill Weir ofTregrill.<br/>Often the same family names occur, either as being in responsible positions, or of a disreputable brood. In 1514, John Ronnel, presumably a relation of Robert, was accused of being a common poacher, and of breeding hares illegally. The Doby family were in frequent trouble. In 1512 John Doby was accused of an obscure crime on the Day of St Katherine the Virgin, and the same crime was committed again on the Sunday after St. Lucy's Day, for which he were fined 3d. Maybe he drank a little too<br/>much, for the first record of him is in 1518/9 when he paid 12d for a licence to brew and sell ale. In 1519 his wife, with others, stole 100 faggots. John died some time prior to<br/>1525 when his widow was in court accused of being a common scold and troublemaker,<br/>a quarrelsome woman who threw stones at her neighbour's porch. She was again before</p>
    <p class="s9">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D.I600</p>
    <p>the court in the following year for allowing her pigs to root up the cemetery. John Ronnel the poacher was evidently little liked, and in 1506 he was assaulted by John Warren and his wife Blanche at Lambesr, but there is no indication of what provoked the attack.<br/>The Vicar of Menheniot had cause to complain to the King in 1514 over the behaviour of one of the Trelawnys.<br/>&quot;To the King our most Soveraign Lorde,</p>
    <p class="s17">'1n moste humble wise show unto yor highnes yor chapelain and dayley orator, Petur Carseleigh, cierk, Vicar of Menheniot in Cornewall, that whereas he and his predecessors hath been possessed tyme out of mind of the Mancion Place of the Vicarage of Menheniot, with certayn grounde and two courtleges belonging, so it is that one Water Trelawny,</p>

    <p class="s38">It <span class="p">would seem that the influence of the great Trelawny family had prevented the vicar obtaining justice at a more local level.</span></p>
    <p>In 1516 there was an interesting entry about the paternity of two men, there having been evidm dispute about whether their futher had been William Boste or Andrew Pole,</p>
    <p class="s17">
      <span class="s8">&quot;... </span>and by this their presentment they woole that Henry Symon and Richard Symon shu/de come to the next Court of the Manor after St. Barnabas day and bring with them four foithfol and lawfol men within the pyshe <span class="p">(parish) </span>and Manor of Menheniot and Tything of Tregrill and to take a nothe upon a b ke <span class="p">(an oath upon the Bible) </span>that the said Henry and Richard cam not of the yssue of Andrew Pole as nothing the <span class="s8">........</span><span class="p">(?) </span>of the said Henry and</p>

    <p>It is recorded in the Court Leet of 1515 that a certain Roger Symon had been the canal raker. If he was a brother to Richard and Henry, his parentage went unquestioned.</p>
    <p class="s41">26</p>
    <p class="s9">MediaevaL Menheniot</p>
    <p>There was no suggestion of asking the mother about the paternity so it must be presumed she was dead, bur unless the four &quot;faithful and lawful men&quot; actually witnessed the procreation it is difficult to see how they could have known the answer</p>
    <p class="s16">to <span class="p">this particular question! Henry and Richard bore the surname of the mother, Symon, who dearly was not married to either of the named potential fathers.</span></p>
    <p>When tempers ran high, common tools could be used as weapons if a fight ensued. In 1516 John Hebron assaulted John Stoterygge with a hedge-bill, and, not surprisingly, &quot;drew blood&quot;. Road surfaces were a matter for complaint in the mediaeval period, just<br/>as they are today. In 1519 bad roads were reported in the Decena ofTregrylla, &quot;viz; from<br/>Doddacross to Hyppell Bridge, and from Trewynt Cross <span class="s16">to </span>the Porta de Treihyll&quot;.<br/>More names and offices were recorded in 1517. John Shave, the butcher whose name has been noted previously, was appointed as &quot;ale taster&quot;. Richard Doyngnell was the bailiff, William Martyn, William Pitt and Jo Hoper were named in responsible positions, and Ralph Harne was the tithing-man.<br/>Jo Hoper had a relation, Christopher, who attacked John Doyngnell with a sword, drawing blood. The reasons for these fights were never recorded, and it was rarely<br/>shown what punishments were given. However there is one record of the bailiff being</p>
    <p class="s17">
      <span class="p">fined for not presenting evidence to the court, </span>'John Mayon of Higher Clicker on 27th june in the house <span class="s43">of </span>Thomas Benalva at Bodway with a dagarius <span class="p">(dagger) </span>worth 10 pence assaulted john Mayon junior <span class="p">(his son?) </span>and drew blood. The Bailiff is amerced <span class="p">(fined) </span>for</p>
    <p class="s17">not having the dagarius aforesaid.&quot;</p>
    <p>By 1523 the enviable position of ale-raster was held by Walter Hawkin, the reeve was Edward Walshe, the bailiff, William Spicer, and the Clerk to the Market, John Webb. The wood warden was Richard Symon (he of doubtful parentage) and the canal raker Roger Trote. From these records it is possible to get derails of the people and their lives, and to ascertain how those lives were governed.<br/>There is a good description of Menheniot Parish written by Leyland between<br/>1533 and 1552.</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;Cumming out of Liskarde about half a mile, <span class="s44">!left </span>Cotyder, a goodly lordship and an old maner place, on the right hand; it is a hundereth pound by the yere.

    <p>(nicely wooded). &quot;<br/>By <span class="s17">Tregelly </span>Leyland meant Tregrill. Today in Tregrill there are two sites of historic interest. The old original hall house, which remains intact, is now known as Tregrill Yean or Little Tregrill, but at some time in the past a larger mansion was built on<br/>the site of the present Tregrill Farm, and the ruins of this are perhaps the subject of Layland's reference. The existing building dates from the early 19th century, and ruins of a previous building are known to have existed there.<br/>1549 marked the Prayer Book Rebellion in Cornwall. This, reduced to its most simple argument, was an objection to the introduction of the English language in church services to replace the Latin that had been previously used. Although the main service was in Latin, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments had always been taught in the vernacular, whether English, Welsh, Gaelic or C rnish.<br/>The religious and political undertones were more than just a matter oflanguage, they involved the confrontation between the old Catholic and the new Protestant faith, and during the reigns of the Tudors the official religion of the nation changed from one monarch to another. The Cornish people wanted the Catholic Latin service, and they objected strongly to the imposition of English as used by the Protestants.<br/>The Vicar ofMenheniot at that time, Dr. John Moreman, played a key role in the rebellion. Moreman was a former Fellow of Exeter College; he was a scholar, and kept<br/>a school at Menheniot where Hooker, the famous Exeter historian, was a pupil. In spite of his scholarship, Moreman's handwriting was very bad, so bad that Lawrence Travers, the vicar ofQuethiok, wrote out for him his work on St. Paul's Epistle. Ironically <span class="s38">it</span><br/>was Moreman who had first abandoned the Cornish language for teaching the Creed,<br/>Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments, introducing English for that purpose. He was, according to Hooker,</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;the first in those days that taught his parishioners and people to say the Lord's Prayer, their</p>
    <p class="s17">Belief and the Commandments, and did teach and catechise them therein.&quot;</p>
    <p class="s8">28</p>
    <p class="s9">Mediaeval Menheniot</p>
    <p>Whitaker states that this</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;was not desired by the Cornish; but forced upon them <span class="s44">by </span>the tyranny of England, at a time when the English Language was yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.&quot;</p>
    <p>This was almost certainly an overstatement, since records show that in Menheniot English was spoken, while there is no evidence of Cornish being used as the dominant language. Further west however, where there were still Cornish monoglors, the argument held good. It is more likely that Moreman stopped using the Cornish language because it was <span class="s17">so </span>little heard in his parish. However, Moreman refused to drop the Latin service, and rejected the English Prayer Book. He was arrested, much</p>
    <p class="s16">to <span class="p">the consternation of those who wanted </span>to <span class="p">keep the old style religion and familiar</span></p>
    <p>Latin service.<br/>Another player in the rebellion, albeit a less obvious one, must have been Agnes Trelawny of Menheniot. She had married John Wynslade who, with his son, was one of the rebel leaders. There is a charming account of John enfeoffing her with his lands at Tregarrick by the symbolic &quot;delivery of possession to the said Agnes only by a turf and a bough at the entering in of the hall-door of the house.&quot;<br/>The demands of the rebels were dearly set out. Item 3 stated, &quot;We wyll have the<br/>Masse in Lateen, as was before&quot;, and item 8 reinforced this with the words,</p>
    <p class="s20">''<i>We </i><span class="s17">wil not receyve the newe servyce because it is but lyke a Christmas game, but</span></p>
    <p class="s17">we wil have oure olde servyce of Mattens, Masse, Evemong and procession in Latten not in Englysh, as it was before,. And so we the Cornyshe men, whereof certen of us understand no Englysh, utterly refuse thys new Englysh.&quot;</p>
    <p>Item 11 showed the strong support given to the Vicar of Menheniot.</p>
    <p class="s17">&quot;We wyll have Doctor Moreman and Doctor Crispin which olde our opiniom to be savely sent unto us and to them we requyre the Kinge's maiesy <span class="p">(mercy), </span>to geve certain lyvinges to preach among us our Catholycke faith.&quot;</p>
    <p>On Mary's accession the religion changed again; Moreman was released from prison, and returned to Menheniot. John Wynslade was not so fortunate; he had already been hung, leaving Agnes Wynslade nee Trelawny a widow. Although only the<br/>bare bones of the facts are known, loyalties, personal emotions and sympathies must</p>
    <p class="s41">29</p>
    <p class="s18">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D.I600</p>
    <p>have been strongly aroused during this troublesome time. There may have been yet more bitter feelings within the Trelawny family. Only the year before the Prayer Book Rebellion, the Reskymer Papers noted that &quot;John Trelauny&quot; was one of those who acted on behalf of the king to put down a smaller insurrection provoked by religious changes, and a forerunner to the greater rebellion in 1549. Details are lacking about family divisions in this matter.<br/>For a man of Dr. Moreman's standing to be at Menheniot, and running what was surely a prestigious school, the benefice must have been a rich one. Apart from the legal agreements within the church, which ensured a comfortable living for the vicar, the ordinary people probably lived in better circumstances than most. Lake's Parochial History notes that Menheniot was famous for its wheat, which would have brought wealth to the area. Poorer parishes in the west of Cornwall grew fields of <b>pillas, </b>a Cornish word for <i>avena nuda, </i>naked oats, which was the staple diet of the common people, and eaten as gurty porridge. In Menheniot it is safe to assume that frumenty, also called fermety, formed the basis of many meals. This was whole wheat, simmered gently until the grains were swollen, rather like rice. Richer people would add cream, spices and honey, but poor folk would eat it plain. Sometimes it was left to cool, and kept until it started to ferment.<br/>The lands surrounding Menheniot would have looked very different centuries ago. Only breeding and milking beasts were over-wintered in mediaeval days, most being slaughtered and salted down in autumn. Fowls were usually plentiful, and most lords<br/>had a dovecote, although these were resented by the common folk because the doves ate their seeds before they had a chance to grow. The fields that are seen around Menheniot today only came into existence with the Enclosures Act in the 18th cent. Much was downland, as we can tell today by the name ofTregrill Downs farm. In mediaeval days peasants worked the fertile land on a field-strip system, each man having strips ofland scattered throughout the manor. Somewhere on the outskirts of Menheniot would have been an estover, or woodland from which the people had a right to take hous-bote, or hay-bote, wood for the repair of their homes or fences.<br/>Fish from Looe no doubt found its way to the village to supplement the diet, but no records exist to show the sales. Bees were kept to provide honey, and old bee boles (hollows in walls to hold bee skeps) still exist at Tregrill. Rabbits did not enter Britain until after 1066, and at first were kept only by the lords in private and enclosed<br/>warrens. We do not know where the Menheniot warren was situated, although it is</p>
    <p class="s41">30</p>
    <p class="s18">Mediaeval Menhenioc</p>
    <p>almost certain that one existed. Rabbit warrens were usual on manors, and interestingly the surname Cunynger (=rabbit warren, OED <span class="s17">conynger) </span>was found in mediaeval Menheniot records. <span class="s38">It </span>was nor until rabbits escaped and bred freely that peasants had access to them as a food supply.<br/>There was an enclosed deer park to the south of the village between the River<br/>Seaton and what is now the railway line, but this was kept for the use of the lord of<br/>the manor, and woe to any peasants caught poaching there!A note in the 1569 Muster Roll of Cornwall makes reference to this deerpark and the fact that the owner was obliged by law to keep brood mares for good horses in times of warfare.&quot;A statute of<br/>the realm, dated 27 Hen Vlll (in the 27th year of the reign of Henry the Eighth), says that because the &quot;brede of horse is sore decayed&quot; all owners of deerparks one mile in circumference had <span class="s26">to </span>keep two brood mares thirteen hands high, and owners of parks four miles in circumference, four such mares. John Trelawny, then deceased, had possessed a deerpark with a circumference between one and four miles, at the time of the Muster Roll it was in the hands of Queen Elizabeth 1st.<br/>Many features of mediaeval Menhenior may have disappeared, bur to imagine the village as it once was it is necessary <span class="s26">to </span>be aware of the changes that have taken place. There would have been wattle and daub huts, no doubt thatched with the plentiful wheat straw. Better houses were later built from blocks of turf, or later cob, which is a mixture of mud and straw. Only a few stone buildings existed which may<br/>have had either thatch or helling-srone roofs. There was more woodland, and there were no hedges dividing the fields, but there would have been a few pounds, small enclosures probably made of wattle <span class="s16">to </span>keep in strays or special animals, and the very high steep banks of the deerpark would have been outstanding.<br/>More insight into village life comes from the Church Warden's accounts.<br/>The money spent in 1576 was 2s for a Bible, and ls for a dock for the church. Money was also paid to John Gerden, Ales Morhed and Margery Wen moth for an unspecified reason, 15d in all, and ls to John Harvy for killing a fox. In the following year the Wardens were William Bray, and William Austin, and their guarantors were Thomas Snell and William May respectively. They had 3 burials, costing 8s 3d and 4 weddings costing 16d.<br/>There is a record ofland value in 1593 through the Tregrill Manor Rental. At Pengover, Robert Moyle esq. paid ls rent for half an acre (Cornish). Thomas May, gent, also paid</p>
    <p class="s8">31</p>
    <p class="s18">Menheniot- a brief history to A.D. 1600</p>
    <p>the same rem for the same amount of land. William Carswell gent however had half an acre (Cornish) held by knight's service, and quarter of a pound of pepper. John Drake held 2 Cornish acres, and paid socage of either 3d or a pair of gloves!<br/>The mill-lear was valued at 3s. In the same year Thomas Snell had the fulling mill at Tregrill and also the quarry of helling-stones (roofing slates) adjoining. This same quarry was mentioned in several early records; in 1554 it was described as the &quot;shilscone quarry in Tregrill&quot;, (shillec-stone?). The churchwarden's reports for 1567 shows that<br/>12s 3d was paid co the hellier (slater) for helling the church, and chat the price of2000 helling stones and carriage of the same was 6s 4d. The helling-srone quarry was worked for many centuries, and a Deed of Exchange of 1835 describes it as a &quot;coppice and quarry at Tregrill, bounded on the West by the River&quot;. We were told in the same document that it was &quot;rhe slate quarry with the little coppice, road near Tregrill.&quot;<br/>A clearer description was given in the Geological Journal of 1849 where there are reportS concerning the &quot;Roseland Slate Quarry, and that of Stonybridge,&quot; and later there is a further report on the Roseland quarry at Tregrill, and again mentioning chat of Stonybridge. Many examples of these old roofing slates were dug up at Tregrill in the grounds of the original house. Lake's Parochial History commented on the stone quarry, saying it was at &quot;Tregarla&quot;, a metathesis ofTregrilla, and the old settlement<br/>was long called &quot;Carla&quot; colloquially.<br/>In the 1593 all the mills in hand were worth a total of &pound;26 13s 4d, and the fair was worth &pound;6 12s 4d<br/>The cartographer John Norden whose maps of Cornwall were compiled at the end of the 16th century noted the village of Menheniot, bur otherwise only named Tregrill and Pool in the parish, these being to him the important sites.<br/>Through all the records during these centuries there are insights to human characteristics, failings and strengths. The past can come alive through the deeds and words of long dead characters. There has been greed, jealousy, love and loyalty, religious fervour, and percy misdemeanours. We know where the fair was held, where the gallows were, and where the men practiced their archery. We know about the main buildings, some occupations, and the names of chose who worked here.<br/>All these things add to the tapestry of!ocal history, and make Menheniot what it is today.</p>

      <br/>HERE IS NO CLEAR INDICATION of the date when the lazar house (leper colony) was established, but the site is well known. It was built to serve both Liskeard and Menheniot, and was situated on the boundary<br/>between the two, being mostly within Menheniot parish, but with two fields adjoining in Liskeard. As with many other lazar houses, it was dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, pronounced &quot;Maudlin&quot;, and it is under this name that the site is now known. The modern Safeway store now occupies part of the land.<br/><span class="s17">As </span>well as the two fields in Liskeard, there was also a garden, an orchard and half an acre of ground. There was no religious house nearby, so in 1379 the vicar of Menheniot, Hugo Hickelyn, had licence <span class="s16">to </span>celebrate mass in the hospital's chapel.<br/>Maudlin is mentioned as early as c.l194. Between that year and 1326 grants<br/>of indulgences (reductions of time spent in Purgatory in return for good deeds) were made by six popes, eight bishops of Exeter and ten other bishops, an approximate total of 14 years and 400 days, to those who made financial contributions to the colony.<br/>For example, on 19th October 1395 Bishop Stafford of Exeter granted 40 days to<br/>contributors, and in 1436, on June 1st, Bishop Lacey granted another 40 days, again to contributors. In 1441 Bishop Lacey made another grant of 40 days to those who were prepared to construct and repair a highway in Liskeard.<br/>There are records of some of the donors, usually with the amount of money donated by them also being recorded. Six pence was the sum of money most often given by individuals to lazar houses throughout Britain.<br/>1309 Bishop Bytton (&quot;to Liskyret&quot;) 30/-<br/>1419 In the will of]ohn Megre, 9d was left to each leper at Maudlin. (Megre, a citizen of London, was a pewterer)<br/>1574 The Mayor ofLaunceston gave &quot;to the poore lazar house at Lescard&quot; 6d.</p>

    <p>In 1642-4 there were two burials &quot;of the Maudlin House&quot;, one was William Coule, the other name being illegible, and in 1645 there was buried Sampson, son of a lazar woman.<br/>The leper colony was well defined. The parish bounds ofLiskeard were recorded in 1613, commencing with St. Mary Magdalen's Chapel, and proc eding ''by Maudlyn Well to Gara mills....&quot; although Carew of Antony made a note at the end of the<br/>16th cent about the settlement, saying that it was. no longer well endowed or run.<br/>In 1665 Seth Ward, the Bishop of Exeter, received a letter stating that in Liskeard</p>
    <p class="s49">&quot;...hospitals there are none under that notion, only a lazar house in the parish of Menheniot near Liskeard with a chapel for lazar people, now in the custody of one Mr. Hodge, worth by common esteem &pound;10 per annum. There is now no lazar in it: the house and chapel are kept</p>
    <p class="s49">in good repair ready to entertain any such person when presented.&quot;</p>
    <p>Leprosy was now rare, but it was still around or the hospital would not have been kept in a state of preparation. Maudlin gradually declined in importance, until its original use was almost forgotten, and now regrettably few people are aware of the<br/>historical significance of this place or the role it played in local history.</p>

      <br/>OST OF THE PLACE-NAMES OF CORNWALL are in the Cornish language which developed around 1000 A.D. from the British tongue, other members of which are Welsh and Breton.<br/>At the time of the Norman Conquest Cornish was spoken throughout Cornwall, but Anglo-Saxon, which we can loosely call English, was already known in the more easterly parts. While Menheniot is firmly within the Cornish speaking area, there are English names also, but practically all the names that occur in its hisrorical records<br/>are Cornish.<br/>In its lifetime the language underwent considerable changes, and it needs to be realized that names in the eastern parts occur in Old Cornish, which was little removed from the parent tongue of British, and practically identical to the Welsh of that same period. Menheniot lies on the edge of the Old Cornish area where,<br/>as the language fell out of use, the place-names often remain fossilized in their Old Cornish form; and yet our language continued in use here until the 15th century, so that some names also occur in a their later form. Cornish was so little in use in<br/>Menheniot by 1540 that the vicar, Dr John Moreman, obtained permission to teach the common prayers in English, and not in the formerly vernacular Cornish.<br/>Before attempting <span class="s16">to </span>explain some of our local Cornish place-names it is important to bear in mind that even in, say, 1066, most of our Cornish {or British) names had already been in existence for centuries, while some certainly date back more than 2000 years. Their great antiquity therefore often renders them hard to interpret, for they have become corrupted with long use, and this can make interpretation very difficult, even impossible.<br/>Another point that must be made is that while place-names may either consist of a single element (or word), as in the case of Clicker, which is from <span class="s7">diggo, </span>a <span class="s19">cliff </span>or steep rock, most are made up of two or more elements, where the second usually tells us more about the first, as in the case ofTregarrick; and here we need to know that in<br/>Cornish certain words have an effect grammatically upon a word that follows</p>

Such a variery is usualiy rhe sign of an important place.

    <p>HEPWELL.

Birch Valley. </span>But this is uncertain.<br/>PENEARTH formerly Pennarthe is from pen-, <span class="s17">top (oj), </span>and arth (are), <span class="s17">eminence, </span>but the word also occurs as a single element meaning <span class="s17">a bluff, steep slope or cliff. </span>Dodman Point and Gribbin Head were both once known as Penare, the same word in later form.

The meaning of pinka is obscure.<br/>ROSELAND appears to be from rose, rosh, <span class="s17">an uncultivable piece of !and within a form, wasteland, or marsh, </span>often referring to rough valley land.

    <p class="s9">Appendix C Place-name.r</p>
    <p>from Rosenant, <span class="s17">Marsh(y) Valley. </span>Another possible explanation is that this<br/>is a corruption of a lost cognate of the Welsh rhoslyd, simply meaning <span class="s17">marshy.</span><br/>SEATON or formerly Saythen, Seyrhen, Syrhian. This river name is likely to be identical co that of the River Saethon in Wales, and is from zethan, or zeathan, <span class="s17">a dart. </span>Thus: <span class="s17">The (River) Dart, </span>no doubt because of its rapid How,<br/>TENCREEK was Trencrake in the 14th century, from trea, <span class="s17">place or farm, </span>and an, <span class="s17">of or by the, </span>creek or creeg, <span class="s17">mound. </span>This could have been the mound from rhe ruins of<br/>a previous structure, a burial mound, or any sort of mound; creeg is even used for <span class="s17">an anthill. Mound Farm, </span>or <span class="s17">the Farm by the Mound.</span><br/>TREGARRRICK was earlier Tregarrecke, from trea, <span class="s17">form of or by, </span>and carrack or carrick, <span class="s17">a rock. Rock Farm.</span><br/>TREGONDALE was Tregyndale in 1514, and Tregondala in 1321. The emphasis should rightly be on dale, though now sometimes corrupted so as <span class="s16">to </span>be on treg.<br/>It probably contains an ancient British personal name, with the prefix trea.<br/>TREGRILL was an important Domesday manor central <span class="s16">to </span>the very existence ofMenheniot. The name is from trea,form <i>(oj), </i>and probably a very ancient<br/>British personal name, perhaps <span class="s17">Ceril. </span>Thus, conjecrurally, <span class="s17">Ceril's Farm or Settlement.</span><br/>In Cornish tre- <span class="s30">+ </span>Ceril softens c to g, giving us in theory &quot;Tregeril.&quot;<br/>TREHAWKE was Trehauke in 1513. This is <span class="s17">ttea,form, </span>and probably havick (pronounced 'hawik') of summer. A v was often pronounced as a w. This was probably a summer or dairy farm, being sitUated in an exposed position. Stock was moved into higher pastures during the summer. Thus: <span class="s17">Summer or Dairy Farm.</span><br/>TREHILL was Treighyll in 1316, Trighill in 1331. <span class="s17">As </span>trea, place, farm, can grammatically cause a following k to become an h or guttural, this may contain the element keel, <span class="s17">sequestered place. </span>The setting ofTrehill is to this day certainly sequestered. <span class="s17">Hidden-away Farm. </span>Conjectural.<br/>TRENANT is from trea,farm, <span class="s17">place, </span>and nant (OC), MC nans/nanz, <span class="s17">valley.
